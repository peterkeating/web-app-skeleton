# RequireJS is used in the application in order to improve architecture, quality,
# speed & testability of the JavaScript. RequireJS is a module loader that takes
# care of loading JavaScript files in a valid order when the module is required.
# Also part of the library is r.js which includes an optimizer that is utilised
# during the build process. During development it is fine that the modules are
# loaded with separate HTTP requests to the files that define them, however in
# a live production environment this is seen as a performance hinderer. The RequireJS
# optimizer combats this by placing all the required modules for the application
# into a single JavaScript file to reduce the number of HTTP requests.
